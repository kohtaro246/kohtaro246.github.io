About Me
======
I am a second-year master's student in the Vision and Language group at [Machine Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) of [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/). I am supervised by Professor [Tatsuya Harada](https://www.mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/harada/) and Lecturer [Yusuke Mukuta](https://www.mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/mukuta/). Prior to enrolling in the master's program, I received B.E. in the field of [Mechano-Informatics](https://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/course/m-i/index_e.shtml) at The University of Tokyo. 

My fields of interest are machine learning in the field of multimodal humor understanding and computer vision for autonomous vehicles. I am passionate about cross-disciplinary machine learning applications that empowers or enhances the ability of humans. My works range from humor understanding and generation which would enable effective cooperation between humans and robots, to autonomous driving which would enable people without access to safe public transportation to move around easily and safely.
