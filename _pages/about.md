About Me
======
I am a full-time software engineer at [Woven by Toyota](https://woven.toyota/en/) Driverless e-Palette function. I am responsible for developing machine learning modules and hardware drivers for L4 autonomous driving vehicle. I have obtained a Master's Degree in Information Science at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) [Machine Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.mi.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en) researching in the field of Vision and Language models and computational humor.

My fields of interest are machine learning in the field of multimodal humor understanding and autonomous driving technology. I am passionate about cross-disciplinary machine learning applications that empowers or enhances the ability of humans. My works range from humor understanding and generation which would enable effective cooperation between humans and robots, to autonomous driving which would enable people without access to safe public transportation to move around easily and safely.
